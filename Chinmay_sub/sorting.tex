\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1],
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Input:} A sequence of $n$ numbers $ \langle a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \rangle $.
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Output:} A reordered sequence (of size $n$) $ \langle a_{1}^{'}, a_{2}^{'}, ..., a_{n}^{'} \rangle $ of the input sequence such that $ a_{1}^{'} \leq a_{2}^{'} \leq ... \leq a_{n}^{'} $.
\par
\noindent
Consider the following example. Given an input sequence $ \langle 8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 91, 15 \rangle $, a sorting algorithm should return $ \langle 7, 8, 9, 15, 15, 34, 91 \rangle $ as output.
\par
A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{efficiently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
\item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory used by an algorithm in terms of input size. Like time complexity analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat compared to time complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting algorithms.
\par
One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison} are commonly known as \textit{comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm [2]. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer}
paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we will derive the lower bound of any comparison
based sorting algorithm to be $ \Omega (n \log_2 n)$ for an input size of $n$.

\section{Quicksort}
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting an input sequence in an array [1]. For any given subarray, $A[i..j]$, the process is as follows,
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Divide:} The array $A[i..j]$ is partitioned into two subarrays $A[i..k]$ and $A[k + 1..j]$ such that all elements in $A[i..k]$ is less than or equal to all elements in $A[k + 1..j]$. A partitioning procedure is called to determine $k$ such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the $k^{th}$ position (i.e., $A[k]$) does not change its position in the final output array.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Partition procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm.}
	\label{algo:quick_sort1}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure{Partition}{$A,i,j$}\newline
     	\Comment{A is an array of N integers, $A[1..N]$}\newline
     	\Comment{$i$ and $j$ are the start and end of subarray}
      		\State $x \leftarrow A[i]$
      		\State $y \leftarrow i-1$
      		\State $z \leftarrow j+1$ 
      		\While {($true$)}
          		\State $z \leftarrow z-1$ 
          		\While {$A[z] > x$}
            		\State $z \leftarrow z-1$  
          		\EndWhile
      	  		\State $y \leftarrow y+1$
      	  		\While {$A[y] < x$}
            		\State $y \leftarrow y+1$  
          		\EndWhile
          		\If {$y < z$}
          			\State Swap $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
          		\Else
          			\State return $z$ 
          		\EndIf
      		\EndWhile
     	\EndProcedure 
  	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Conquer:} Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two subarrays.
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Merge:} Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array $A[i..j]$ is sorted in place.
\par
In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element $x$ is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line \#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices $y$ and $z$ have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at $A[y]$ and $A[z]$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index $z$, such that all elements to the left of $z$ are smaller than or equal to $A[z]$ and all elements to the right of $z$ are greater than or equal to $A[z]$.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion.}
	\label{algo:quick_sort2}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure{Quicksort}{$A,i,j$}\newline
     	\Comment{Quicksort procedure called with $A, 1, N$}
     		\If {$i < j$}
     			\State $k \leftarrow \textsc{Partition}(A,i,j)$
     			\State \textsc{Quicksort}$(A,i,k)$
     			\State \textsc{Quicksort}$(A,k+1,j)$ 	
          	\EndIf
     	\EndProcedure 
  	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\par
The main recursive procedure for Quicksort is presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT$(A, 1, N )$ where $N$ is the length of array N.

\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length $N$, gets partitioned into two subarrays of size $N-1$ and $1$ in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time is,
\begin{equation*}
T(n) = T(n-1) + \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
As it is evident that $T(1) = \Theta(1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*}
T(n) &= T(n-1) + \Theta(n)\\
&= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\Theta(k)\\
&= \Theta\left( \sum_{k=1}^{n}k \right)\\
&= \Theta(n^2)
\end{align*}
\par
Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^2)$. Intutively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{equation*}
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
which evaluates to $\Theta(n \log_2 n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O(n \lg n)$.

\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms based on comparisons is the following: What is  the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.
\par
A decision tree based analysis leads to the following theorem [1].
\begin{theorem}
Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega(n \log_2(n))$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider a decision tree of height $h$ that sorts $n$ elements. Since there are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least $n!$ leaves. Since a binary tree of height h has no more than $2^h$ leaves. So,
\begin{flalign*}
& \ \ n! \leq 2^h &
\end{flalign*}
Applying logarithmic $(\log_2)$, the inequality becomes,
\begin{flalign*}
& h \geq \lg(n!). &
\end{flalign*}
Applying Stirling's approximations,
\begin{flalign*}
& n! \geq \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n, &
\end{flalign*}
where $e$ is natural base of logarithms. Further,
\begin{align*}
h & \geq \lg \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \\
&= n \lg n - n \lg e \\
&= \Omega (n \lg n)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
